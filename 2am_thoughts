make "shape" and "axis" object extensions
we need hover/click callbacks
also animations... should probably make a return? maybe tho this time its simpler (just a function you can override)

custom ctx object to wrap over the HTML5 one
draw shit from center point insead of corner
potentially easier functions to work with (eg: think line drawing...)

axis / examples to make
- line
- bar
- radar
- pie

also one of the examples needs to be dashboardy to show the power of multiple graphics interfaces.
