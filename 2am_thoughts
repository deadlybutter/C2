make "shape" and "axis" object extensions
we need hover/click callbacks
also animations... should probably make a return? maybe tho this time its simpler (just a function you can override)

axis / examples to make
- line
- bar
- radar
- pie

pick more fun things from here https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery

also one of the examples needs to be dashboardy to show the power of multiple graphics interfaces.
